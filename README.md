## Machine Learning and Cars

This project has got many ingredientes: Obviously first of all the use of machine learning libraries in Python, sklearn, panda and numpy.
Once the model has been trained and we compare the models to find the most accurate, the best model is dumped into a file using pickle. This file is used to make a prediction in the predictor.py file. To set up the web page we decided to use Streamlit library, whichi is very powerful for simple apps and very easy to learn. This framework, like NiceGui or Taipy are based upon the idea that we can build a webpage using python entirely without resorting to more complex solutions like Flask or Django. You do not need to now javascript or html to build a website using Streamlit. Plus Streamlit can host your webpage for free. 

you can visit the page we created at https://ml-cars.streamlit.app/
